"Juicy Ideas" I thought to add to make the UI more pretty were:
1. A proper Start title and Settings scene
2. Moving clouds
3. A sky Gradient that gives a night and day feel
4. different collisions (collisions aside from pipes to add more scenery)
5. Allowing the user to pick the color of their bird
6. Adding some sort of simple story or text box of some kind

I ultimately chose 2. and 3.
